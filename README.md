# Code Refactor - Horiseon

## Description

This project was to ensure the existing Horiseon webpage was functioning as intended and met accessibility standards for webpages. Upon reviewing the initial HTML and CSS code I discovered several broken links, missing Alt text on images, illogical semantic structure, and incorrect heading orders. I was able to successfully restore the functionality of the webpage and increase the accessibility standard. When I completed the initial tasks I was able to then reorganize and clean the code to remove repetitive code and improve readability for the next developer.
